    - toLowercase

## Why use OOP

## parts of OOP
    - object literal

- Constructor Function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instenses (new, this)

## 4 Pillars

- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together into a single unit called an object, and hiding the internal details of how the object works.

- Inheritance: Creating new classes (derived classes) from existing classes (base classes), allowing the derived classes to inherit the properties and methods of the base classes.

- Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. It allows objects to be treated as instances of their own class or as instances of their parent class.

- Abstraction: Simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. It involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define the common behavior of a group of objects.
